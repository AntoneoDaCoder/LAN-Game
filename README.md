ugh so
if anyone reads it and downloads this project, there are few things i want to note:
1. i do not own any resources (models, sounds, music etc.) that were used for this game
2. i do own however the idea and code
3. for the project to work after downloading unpack music folder, then cut it out and paste into RSS folder;
after you open solution file, go to bin/debug/net8.0/ and cut out and paste RSS folder here
otherwise nothing is going to work
